# DOM-Game
A little game purely made using DOM elements instead of Canvas2D, WebGL or SVG.

You can play it on https://bonsaiheldin.github.io/DOM-Game/

Amazing that it actually works quite good, isn't it? ðŸ˜€

It may have its limitations, but i think for very small games the DOM could be enough. Not having tested on mobiles though.
